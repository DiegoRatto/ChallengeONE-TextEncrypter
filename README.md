## Instruccions

Work on an application that encrypts texts, so you can exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" that we will use are the following:

The letter "e" is converted to "enter" The letter "i" is converted to "imes" The letter "a" is converted to "ai" The letter "o" is converted to "ober" The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"


## Requirements

- It should work only with lowercase letters

- Letters with accents or special characters should not be used.

- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version.


For example: "cat" => "gaitober" gaitober" => "cat"

The page must have fields for inserting the text that will be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options. The result should be displayed on the screen.

## Extra


A button that copies the encrypted/decrypted text for the transfer section, that is, it has the same functionality as ctrl+C or the "copy" option from the applications menu.
